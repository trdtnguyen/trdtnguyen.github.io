I'm a data engineer/software engineer with a Ph.D. and over 5 years’ experience in developing, and optimizing web applications and Database Management Systems. I'm currently working toward a certificate in data engineering where I'm growing my skills in Python, SQL, Data Warehousing, Azure, Apache Airflow, Apache Kafka, Docker, and Kubernetes. I also currently using my knowledge and skills in helping college students with computer science subjects (Database Management, C++, Java, and Python) as a online part-time tutor.
